        <h1>Bienenstich (the Viking honey cake)</h1>

        <p>The bienenstich, which in German translates to "bee sting," is a delicious dessert. It's made on a yeasty sweet bread, so it's a little more savory than a regular cake. However, what it loses sweetness in the body, it makes up for on top, with its crunchy, honey almond coat. What's even better about this cake is the history. This cake's name was founded in the 15th century after German raiders successfully conquered a neighboring village by flinging swarming beehives into the throng. I like to think that they were vikings. Honey-crazed vikings.</p>
