        <h1>NETTLE SOUP (NASSELSOPPA)</h1>

        <p>Nasselsoppa is a well-known sign of spring in Sweden with hard-boiled eggs and creme fraiche as traditional accompaniments. Packed with nutrition and flavour, nettles have high quantities of iron, calcium, vitamin A and K. In medieval Europe they were used medicinally as a diuretic and to treat joint pain. Early nettles are tender and perfect for cooking.</p>
