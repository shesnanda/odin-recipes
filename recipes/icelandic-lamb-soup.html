        <h1>ICELANDIC LAMB SOUP (KJOTSUPA)</h1>

        <p>One of Iceland's most important dishes, Kjotsupa is a simple lamb soup made with winter root vegetables. It is a straightforward recipe that reflects the Nordic culture and the practice of cooking with what is in season and on hand. Truly authentic Kjotsupa has very little seasoning except for salt and pepper; however, this version includes thyme and oregano, bringing a little earthiness to the soup.</p>
